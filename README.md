> This project involves building a voice-activated chatbot using Python that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to understand and respond to user queries. It uses speech recognition to convert voice to text, natural language processing (NLP) to interpret commands, and text-to-speech (TTS) for vocal responses. The assistant can handle tasks like answering questions, fetching information, opening applications, or performing web searches. ML models may be used to improve intent recognition and personalize responses over time. A custom GUI can enhance user interaction with animated feedback and control buttons.
Key Technologies:
- Python
- SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, OpenAI/OpenRouter API
- NLTK or spaCy for NLP
- Tkinter or customtkinter for GUI
- Threading for real-time responsiveness
